# Snakes Ladders And Nukes
A server-client game of Snakes and Ladders with the distinction that there are also nuclear weapons. Pick up the biggest atomic bombs around as you move around the board and constantly nuke your opponents (or usually when they're 6 or less squares away from winning) to achieve victory. The game progressively gets more dystopic and scary as more nukes are used, because in nuclear war, there are no winners ヾ(≧▽≦*)o

To play, run python3 on client.py, in the same directory as gameconfig.ini and the Assets folder, or client.exe. Windows will think client.exe is a trojan, there's not much that can be done because of how 'compiling' python files to exe files works. If you're scared just run it with python3

Comes packed with sound effects and music that is totally original and I made myself yes (music: Papers Please theme and But Nobody Came from Undertale, sound effects MW2 nuke sounds)
